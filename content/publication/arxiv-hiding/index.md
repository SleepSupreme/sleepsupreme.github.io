abstract: Data hiding is the art of concealing messages with limited perceptual
  changes. Recently, deep learning has provided enriching perspectives for it
  and made significant progress. In this work, we conduct a brief yet
  comprehensive review of existing literature and outline three
  meta-architectures. Based on this, we summarize specific strategies for
  various applications of deep hiding, including steganography, light field
  messaging and watermarking. Finally, further insight into deep hiding is
  provided through incorporating the perspective of adversarial attack.
