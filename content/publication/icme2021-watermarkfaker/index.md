abstract: Digital watermarking has been widely used to protect copyright and
  integrity of multimedia data. Previous studies mainly focus on designing
  watermarking techniques that are robust to attacks of destroying the embedded
  watermarks. However, the emerging deep learning based image generation
  technology raises new open issue that whether it is possible to generate fake
  watermarked images for circumvention. In this paper, we make the first attempt
  to develop digital image watermark fakers by using generative adversarial
  learning. Supposing that a set of paired images of original and watermarked
  images generated by the watermarker under attack are available, we use them to
  train a watermark faker with U-Net as the backbone, whose input is bit-wise
  representation of original images and output is fake watermarked images. Our
  experiments show that the proposed faker can effectively crack digital image
  watermarkers in both spatial and frequency domain, suggesting the risk of such
  forgery attacks.
