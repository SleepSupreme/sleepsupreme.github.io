abstract: Digital watermarking has been widely used to protect the copyright and
  integrity of multimedia data. Previous studies mainly focus on designing
  watermarking techniques that are robust to attacks of destroying the embedded
  watermarks. However, the emerging deep learning based image generation
  technology raises new open issues that whether it is possible to generate fake
  watermarked images for circumvention. In this paper, we make the first attempt
  to develop digital image watermark fakers by using generative adversarial
  learning. Suppose that a set of paired images of original and watermarked
  images generated by the targeted watermarker are available, we use them to
  train a watermark faker with U-Net as the backbone, whose input is an original
  image, and after a domain-specific preprocessing, it outputs a fake
  watermarked image. Our experiments show that the proposed watermark faker can
  effectively crack digital image watermarkers in both spatial and frequency
  domains, suggesting the risk of such forgery attacks.
