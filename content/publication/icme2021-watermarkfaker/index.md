abstract: "Digital watermarking has been widely used to protect copyright and integrity of multimedia data. Previous studies mainly focus on designing watermarking techniques that are robust to attacks of destroying the embedded watermarks. However, the emerging deep learning based image generation technology raises new open issue that whether it is possible to generate fake watermarked images for circumvention. In this paper, we make the first attempt to develop digital image watermark fakers by using generative adversarial learning. Supposing that a set of paired images of original and watermarked images generated by the watermarker under attack are available, we use them to train a watermark faker with U-Net as the backbone, whose input is bit-wise representation of original images and output is fake watermarked images. Our experiments show that the proposed faker can effectively crack digital image watermarkers in both spatial and frequency domain, suggesting the risk of such forgery attacks."
